# Chat Deletion Fix - Summary

## Problem
When users deleted a chat in the frontend, it disappeared temporarily but reappeared after refreshing the page. The chat was being removed from the frontend state but not actually deleted from the database.

## Root Causes

### 1. **Wrong Column Name in SQL Query**
The `deleteChat` method in `CORE_ConversationRepository.js` was using the wrong column name:
- **Bug**: Used `session_id` in the WHERE clause for `conversation_logs`
- **Fix**: Changed to `chat_id` (the correct column name per the schema)

```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
DELETE FROM conversation_logs WHERE session_id = ?

// AFTER (correct)
DELETE FROM conversation_logs WHERE chat_id = ?
```

### 2. **Foreign Keys Not Enabled in SQLite**
SQLite doesn't enable foreign key constraints by default, which meant CASCADE deletes weren't working automatically.

- **Fix**: Added `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` when creating the database connection in `setupServices.js`

### 3. **Incomplete Cascade Deletion**
The deletion wasn't removing all related records. Even with foreign keys enabled, some tables needed explicit deletion.

- **Fix**: Added explicit DELETE statements for:
  - `commitments` (chat assignments)
  - `events` (scheduled character meetings) - with error handling for missing table
  - `character_psychological_state` (psychology data)
  - `proactive_engagements` (proactive messages)

## Files Modified

### 1. `/backend/dal/repositories/CORE_ConversationRepository.js`
- Fixed column name from `session_id` to `chat_id` for conversation_logs deletion
- Added deletion of commitments, events, psychology state, and proactive engagements
- Added error handling for events table (may not exist if migrations not run)

### 2. `/setupServices.js`
- Enabled foreign key constraints: `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`
- Added logging when foreign keys are enabled

## Verification
A comprehensive test was created and successfully verified:
✅ Foreign keys are enabled  
✅ Chat is deleted from database  
✅ All conversation messages are deleted  
✅ All commitments are deleted  
✅ No orphaned records remain  

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Relationships
```
chats (id)
  ├─→ conversation_logs (chat_id) - CASCADE
  ├─→ commitments (chat_id) - CASCADE
  ├─→ events (chat_id) - CASCADE
  ├─→ character_psychological_state (session_id = chat.id) - CASCADE
  ├─→ proactive_engagements (chat_id) - CASCADE
  └─→ character_memory_weights (session_id = chat.id)
```

### API Flow
1. **Frontend** (`ChatContext.tsx`): Calls `DELETE /api/chat/${chatId}`
2. **Backend API** (`chatRoutes.js`): Validates user ownership, calls DAL
3. **Data Access Layer** (`ConversationRepository.js`): Executes cascade deletion
4. **Database**: Deletes chat and all related records

## Impact
- ✅ Chat deletion now persists across page refreshes
- ✅ No orphaned data in database
- ✅ Proper data isolation (user can only delete their own chats)
- ✅ Foreign key constraints enforced for data integrity

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test chat deletion in the UI
2. Verify chat doesn't reappear after refresh
3. Check that related data (commitments, messages) are also deleted
4. Verify other users' chats are not affected

## Notes
- The `events` table is defined in a migration file (`005_events_table.sql`) rather than the main schema, so the deletion code includes error handling for when this table doesn't exist
- Foreign key constraints are now globally enabled, which improves data integrity across the entire application
