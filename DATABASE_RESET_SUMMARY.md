# Database Reset Complete ✅

## Current State

### Users (Preserved)
- **Bjoern** (`e5500cad-e6e0-45ed-b20a-63b81fdb22a4`)
- **Steve** (`30b2ae99-c903-47b8-abed-a4b68ce07487`)
- **dev-user-001** (Developer test account)

### Data Cleaned
✅ All characters deleted (0 remaining)
✅ All chats deleted (0 remaining)
✅ All conversations deleted (0 remaining)
✅ All commitments deleted (0 remaining)
✅ All events deleted (0 remaining)
✅ All psychology states deleted (0 remaining)
✅ All proactive engagements deleted (0 remaining)

## Next Steps

### 1. Refresh the Frontend
Open the application in your browser and do a **hard refresh**:
- **Mac:** Cmd + Shift + R
- **Windows/Linux:** Ctrl + Shift + R

### 2. Import Characters

The character import is **correctly configured** to use the authenticated user's ID:
- Import happens at: `POST /api/characters/import?userId={userId}`
- The import endpoint automatically assigns characters to the logged-in user

**Import Process:**
1. **Log in as Bjoern**
2. Navigate to Characters page
3. Click "Import Character"
4. Upload **Aria.json**
5. Aria will be automatically assigned to Bjoern

6. **Log out and log in as Steve**
7. Navigate to Characters page
8. Click "Import Character"
9. Upload **Lexi.json**
10. Click "Import Character" again
11. Upload **Sonja.json**
12. Both characters will be automatically assigned to Steve

### 3. Verification

After importing:
- **Bjoern** should only see Aria
- **Steve** should only see Lexi and Sonja
- Neither user can see or access the other's characters

## Technical Details

### What Was Fixed
1. **Character Import:** Already correctly uses `user_id: userId` (line 433 of charactersRoutes.js)
2. **Character Listing:** Uses `getUserCharacters(userId)` - only returns user's characters
3. **Character CRUD:** All operations verify ownership before allowing access
4. **Chat Messages:** Verify character ownership before processing

### Database Schema
- The `personalities` table has a `user_id` column (added by migration 007)
- All character operations enforce user isolation
- Frontend uses authenticated user's ID from AuthContext

## Clean State Guaranteed
✅ No orphaned data
✅ No old character references
✅ No default-user associations
✅ No dev-user-001 characters
✅ Fresh start for both users

**Status:** Ready for character import!
