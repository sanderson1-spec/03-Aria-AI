# Authentication System - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What Was Implemented

A complete authentication system has been added to solve your multi-device chat synchronization issue!

**Problem Solved**: Your chats from desktop now properly sync to mobile (and vice versa) because each user has their own account instead of using a hardcoded user ID.

---

## 🚀 How to Get Started

### 1. Start the Application

```bash
cd /Users/bjoern/Development/Repositories/03\ Aria-AI
npm start
# or
npm run dev
```

The app will start on:
- **Backend**: http://localhost:3001
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173

### 2. First Time Use

1. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
2. You'll see a beautiful login page
3. Click **"Create one"** to register
4. Fill in:
   - **Username**: Any username (min 3 characters)
   - **Display Name**: Optional (defaults to username)
   - **Password**: Any password (no requirements - it's a hobby project!)
   - **Confirm Password**: Same as password
5. Click **"Create Account"**
6. You're automatically logged in! 🎉

### 3. On Your Mobile Device

1. Find your computer's IP address:
   ```bash
   # On Mac/Linux:
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   # Look for something like: 192.168.1.x
   ```

2. Open on mobile:
   - Go to: `http://YOUR_IP:5173` (e.g., http://192.168.1.100:5173)
   - **Login with the same username and password** you created
   - Your chats will sync automatically! ✨

### 4. Using the App

- **Creating Chats**: Works exactly as before
- **User Menu**: Click your avatar at the bottom of the sidebar to logout
- **Switch Users**: Logout and login with a different account
- **Multiple Devices**: Login on as many devices as you want with the same account

## 🔐 Key Features

- ✅ **Simple Registration**: No email required, just username & password
- ✅ **Remember Me**: Sessions last 30 days automatically
- ✅ **Cross-Device Sync**: Login on any device and see your chats
- ✅ **Secure**: Passwords are hashed with bcrypt

## 📱 Network Access (Important!)

For mobile access to work, ensure:

1. **Both devices on same WiFi network**
2. **Firewall allows connections on port 3001** (backend) and **5173** (frontend)
3. **Use your computer's local IP**, not localhost

### Test Network Access

On mobile, try:
- Backend: `http://YOUR_IP:3001/health` (should show JSON)
- Frontend: `http://YOUR_IP:5173` (should show login page)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Can't access from mobile
```bash
# Check if ports are open
lsof -i :3001  # Backend should be running
lsof -i :5173  # Frontend should be running

# On Mac, allow incoming connections:
# System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Firewall > Firewall Options
# Ensure Node.js can accept incoming connections
```

### "Authentication required" error
- Make sure you're logged in (you should see the login page if not)
- Try logging out and back in
- Clear browser cache if issues persist

### Chats not syncing
- Ensure you're logged in with the **same account** on both devices
- Check backend is running (`http://YOUR_IP:3001/health`)
- Look for errors in browser console (F12)

### Backend won't start
```bash
# Make sure bcrypt is installed
npm install

# Check for port conflicts
lsof -i :3001  # Kill any existing process

# Run with logging
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Test It Works

### Quick Test Sequence

1. **Desktop Browser**:
   - Register new account: username `test`, password `test123`
   - Create a chat with a character
   - Send a message

2. **Mobile Browser**:
   - Navigate to `http://YOUR_IP:5173`
   - Login with username `test`, password `test123`
   - **You should see the chat you just created!** ✨

3. **Send messages from either device** - they should sync instantly!

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Remember your credentials**: There's no password reset (yet), so don't forget them!
2. **Use display name**: Set a friendly display name when registering
3. **Multiple accounts**: You can create multiple accounts for testing
4. **Stay logged in**: Sessions last 30 days, so you won't need to login often
5. **Sign out**: Always sign out on shared devices using the user menu
