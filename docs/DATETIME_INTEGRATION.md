# DateTime Integration for Character Awareness

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive datetime integration that ensures all AI characters in the system have access to current date and time information. This integration is critical for natural, time-aware conversations.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status

**COMPLETE** - All characters now have full datetime awareness across all interaction points.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **DateTimeUtils** (`backend/utils/datetime_utils.js`)
   - Central utility for all datetime operations
   - Provides comprehensive system prompt formatting
   - Handles timezone conversions and relative time calculations

2. **Character-Facing Services** (All updated with datetime context)
   - `ChatRoutes.js` - Main chat interaction endpoint
   - `CORE_ProactiveIntelligenceService.js` - Proactive engagement analysis
   - `CORE_PsychologyService.js` - Psychological state analysis
   - `CORE_ConversationAnalyzer.js` - Conversation flow analysis

## üîß Technical Implementation

### System Prompt Integration

All character interactions now include comprehensive datetime context:

```javascript
const dateTimeContext = DateTimeUtils.getSystemPromptDateTime();
const systemPrompt = `You are ${character.name}, ${character.description}

${dateTimeContext}

Current psychology state: mood=${psychologyState.mood}, engagement=${psychologyState.engagement}, energy=${psychologyState.energy}.
Stay in character as ${character.name}. You are fully aware of the current date and time as provided above.`;
```

### DateTime Context Format

Characters receive:
- **Current date and time** with timezone information
- **UTC time** for precise calculations
- **Current timestamp** for relative time calculations
- **Timezone** information for context
- **Time calculation examples** (1 minute, 5 minutes, 1 hour ahead)
- **Relative time instructions** for processing user requests

Example output:
```
Current date and time: Monday, September 8, 2025 at 09:50 AM GMT+2
Current UTC time: 2025-09-08T07:50:12.768Z
Current timestamp: 1757317812768
Local date: 2025-09-08
Timezone: Europe/Berlin

Time calculation examples for relative times:
- "in 1 minute" = 2025-09-08T07:51:12.768Z
- "in 5 minutes" = 2025-09-08T07:55:12.768Z
- "in 1 hour" = 2025-09-08T08:50:12.768Z

IMPORTANT: Use the current timestamp (1757317812768) for all relative time calculations by adding milliseconds.
```

## üéØ Character Capabilities

With this integration, characters can now:

### ‚è∞ Time Awareness
- Know the current time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night)
- Provide appropriate time-based greetings
- Understand business hours vs. personal time
- Reference the current date for scheduling

### üìÖ Date Awareness
- Know the current date and day of the week
- Understand relative date references ("tomorrow", "next week")
- Handle scheduling requests with proper date context

### ‚è≤Ô∏è Relative Time Processing
- Parse user requests like "remind me in 30 minutes"
- Calculate future timestamps accurately
- Understand time-based scheduling requests

### üåç Timezone Awareness
- Understand the user's timezone context
- Make time-appropriate suggestions
- Handle cross-timezone references properly

## üß™ Testing Coverage

### Test Suites

1. **DateTimeIntegration.test.js** - Core functionality and integration tests
2. **DateTimeRegression.test.js** - Regression prevention tests
3. **chat-workflow-integration.test.js** - End-to-end datetime awareness tests

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**: DateTimeUtils functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Service-level datetime integration
- **Regression Tests**: Prevent accidental removal of datetime context
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full character interaction datetime awareness

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all datetime tests
npm test -- --testPathPatterns="DateTimeIntegration|DateTimeRegression"

# Run specific integration tests
npm test -- --testNamePattern="datetime awareness"
```

## üö® Critical Regression Prevention

The regression tests ensure that:

1. **DateTimeUtils import** is never accidentally removed from character services
2. **DateTime context calls** are never commented out or disabled
3. **API compatibility** is maintained for all datetime utilities
4. **System prompt format** always includes required datetime information

### Regression Test Results
- ‚úÖ 33/33 tests passing
- ‚úÖ All character-facing services verified
- ‚úÖ API contract validation complete
- ‚úÖ Future-proofing tests implemented

## üìù Usage Examples

### Time-Aware Greetings
Characters automatically use appropriate greetings:
- "Good morning" (before 12 PM)
- "Good afternoon" (12 PM - 5 PM)
- "Good evening" (5 PM - 9 PM)
- "Good night" (after 9 PM)

### Scheduling Requests
Characters can handle:
- "Remind me in 30 minutes"
- "Let's talk tomorrow at 2 PM"
- "Can you follow up next week?"
- "What time is it right now?"

### Context-Aware Responses
Characters consider time context for:
- Energy levels (morning vs. evening)
- Appropriate activity suggestions
- Business hours awareness
- Weekend vs. weekday context

## üîÑ Service Integration Points

### ChatRoutes
- **Location**: `backend/api/chatRoutes.js`
- **Integration**: System prompt includes full datetime context
- **Impact**: All user-character interactions are time-aware

### ProactiveIntelligenceService
- **Location**: `backend/services/domain/CORE_ProactiveIntelligenceService.js`
- **Integration**: Proactive analysis considers time factors
- **Impact**: Proactive messages are time-appropriate

### PsychologyService
- **Location**: `backend/services/domain/CORE_PsychologyService.js`
- **Integration**: Psychological analysis includes time-of-day factors
- **Impact**: Character mood and energy consider time context

### ConversationAnalyzer
- **Location**: `backend/services/domain/CORE_ConversationAnalyzer.js`
