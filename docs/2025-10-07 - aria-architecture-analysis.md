## üìù Cursor Workflow Recommendations

### For Each Implementation Task:

1. **Review Project Knowledge First**
   ```
   Always reference the clean architecture guidelines and existing service patterns
   before starting implementation. Use project_knowledge_search to find relevant examples.
   ```

2. **Single File Focus**
   ```
   Implement ONE service at a time. Complete implementation, tests, and validation
   before moving to the next component.
   ```

3. **Validation at Each Step**
   ```bash
   # After implementing each service
   node validate-architecture.js
   npm run test
   ```

4. **Incremental Integration**
   ```
   Don't try to connect everything at once. Build one service, test it in isolation,
   then integrate with next component.
   ```

5. **Use Existing Patterns**
   ```
   Copy the structure from PsychologyService for complex services.
   Copy the structure from ChatRepository for new repositories.
   Copy the structure from chatRoutes.js for new API endpoints.
   ```

### Example Cursor Interaction:

**You:**
```
Create SchedulingService following clean architecture guidelines. 
Check project knowledge for AbstractService patterns and ProactiveRepository usage.
```

**After Cursor generates code:**
```
Now create unit tests for SchedulingService following the pattern 
from tests/services/PsychologyService.test.js
```

**After tests pass:**
```
Integrate SchedulingService into setupServices.js. 
Register with dependencies: ['database', 'logger', 'errorHandling', 'messageDelivery'].
Follow existing service registration patterns.
```

## üîß Development Tips

### Architecture Compliance:
1. **Always** extend AbstractService for new services
2. **Never** use direct SQL outside repositories
3. **Always** use dependency injection via constructor
4. **Never** use console.log (use this.logger instead)
5. **Always** wrap errors with errorHandler

### Testing Strategy:
1. Write unit tests immediately after creating service
2. Test in isolation with mocked dependencies
3. Integration tests for multi-service workflows
4. E2E tests for user-facing features

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
- Don't modify CORE_ files unless absolutely necessary
- Don't create circular dependencies between services
- Don't bypass the DAL for database access
- Don't implement features before proactive messaging works
- Don't skip guardrails - they're essential for user experience

---

## üìà Technical Debt & Future Considerations

### Current Technical Debt:
1. **Authentication** - Basic JWT only, no OAuth, no 2FA
2. **Session Management** - Simple, could be more robust
3. **Rate Limiting** - No API rate limiting implemented
4. **Caching** - No caching layer for frequently accessed data
5. **Logging** - File-based only, no centralized logging service
6. **Monitoring** - No APM or metrics collection

### When to Address:
- **Now:** Focus on proactive messaging (core feature)
- **Soon:** Authentication improvements (if going multi-user)
- **Later:** Caching and monitoring (performance optimization)
- **Future:** Advanced features (voice, collaboration, etc.)

### Scaling Considerations:
- Current architecture supports 5-10 users (hobby project scale)
- SQLite is fine for this scale
- If scaling to 100+ users:
  - Migrate to PostgreSQL
  - Add Redis for caching and job queue
  - Implement horizontal scaling
  - Add load balancer

---

## üé¨ Final Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Start with SchedulingService** - This is the foundation for everything
2. **Then MessageDeliveryService** - Critical for real-time delivery
3. **WebSocket integration** - Connect frontend to backend
4. **Integration testing** - Validate end-to-end flow

### Do NOT:
1. ‚ùå Modify psychology system - it's working well
2. ‚ùå Refactor database schema - it's comprehensive
3. ‚ùå Change service architecture - it's solid
4. ‚ùå Implement learning before basic proactive messaging works
5. ‚ùå Add features before Phase 2 is complete

### Success Metrics:
- **Technical:** All Phase 2 tasks complete and tested
- **User Experience:** Proactive messages feel natural, not spammy
- **Code Quality:** Maintain clean architecture compliance
- **Test Coverage:** >80% code coverage maintained

**The missing piece is mechanical, not creative.** You need scheduling, delivery, and WebSocket integration. These are well-understood problems with clear implementations.

**Recommended approach:**
1. Focus exclusively on Phase 2 (proactive delivery)
2. Don't get distracted by other features
3. Use existing services as templates
4. Test incrementally at each step

**Timeline estimate:**
- Phase 2 (Proactive Delivery): 8-12 hours
- Phase 3 (Guardrails): 4-6 hours  
- Phase 4 (Tasks): 6-8 hours
- **Total to MVP:** ~20-30 hours

You're closer than you think. Let's build this. üöÄ
