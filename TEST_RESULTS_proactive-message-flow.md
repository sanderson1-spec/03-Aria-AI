PASS tests/integration/proactive-message-flow.test.js
  Proactive Message Flow Integration
    Schedule Proactive Message
      ✓ should schedule a proactive message successfully (38 ms)
    Polling and Delivery
      ✓ should detect and deliver due messages via polling (17 ms)
    Offline User Scenario
      ✓ should keep message pending for offline user and deliver when online (8 ms)
      ✓ should track connection status correctly (7 ms)
    End-to-End Proactive Flow
      ✓ should handle complete proactive message lifecycle (9 ms)

## Test Coverage

### 1. Schedule Proactive Message ✅
**Scenario**: Schedule a proactive message successfully
- Creates test user and character
- Schedules proactive message with future timestamp
- Verifies message stored in `proactive_engagements` table
- Validates all message fields (user_id, status, content, timing)
- Performs proper cleanup

### 2. Polling and Delivery ✅
**Scenario**: Detect and deliver due messages via polling
- Schedules message that is already due
- Registers mock WebSocket for user
- Uses `jest.advanceTimersByTime(30000)` to trigger polling
- Verifies SchedulingService detects due message
- Validates message delivery flow
- Tests integration between Scheduling and MessageDelivery services

### 3. Offline User - Keep Pending ✅
**Scenario**: Keep message pending for offline user and deliver when online
- Schedules message for offline user
- Verifies user is not connected
- Confirms message stays pending
- Simulates user coming online (WebSocket connection)
- Attempts message delivery to now-online user
- Tests online/offline state management

### 4. Connection Status Tracking ✅
**Scenario**: Track connection status correctly
- Tests user connection state before registration
- Registers WebSocket connection
- Verifies user is marked as connected
- Checks connection count
- Unregisters connection
- Verifies user is marked as disconnected
- Tests MessageDeliveryService connection tracking

### 5. End-to-End Proactive Flow ✅
**Scenario**: Handle complete proactive message lifecycle
- Creates complete test setup (user, character, connection)
- Schedules proactive message for future delivery
- Verifies initial pending state
- Fast-forwards time to make message due
- Triggers polling cycle
- Validates complete lifecycle from schedule to delivery
- Tests full integration across all services

## Technical Implementation

### Fake Timers Usage
```javascript
beforeEach(async () => {
    jest.useFakeTimers();
    // ... setup
});

afterEach(async () => {
    jest.useRealTimers();
    // ... cleanup
});
```

### Time Advancement
```javascript
// Trigger polling (every 30 seconds)
jest.advanceTimersByTime(30000);

// Wait for async operations
await Promise.resolve();
```

### Mock WebSocket
```javascript
const mockWebSocket = {
    send: jest.fn(),
    readyState: 1,
    close: jest.fn(),
    on: jest.fn()
};
```

## Services Tested

1. **ProactiveIntelligenceService** - Message scheduling logic
2. **SchedulingService** - Background polling and detection
3. **MessageDeliveryService** - Connection management and delivery
4. **Database (DAL)** - Data persistence and retrieval

## Test Patterns Followed

✅ Uses setupServices with in-memory database
✅ beforeEach/afterEach for proper setup/teardown
✅ Creates unique test data using timestamps
✅ Performs comprehensive cleanup (no test data leakage)
✅ Clear, descriptive test names
✅ Step-by-step commented test flow
✅ Specific assertions with meaningful expectations
✅ Follows existing integration test patterns

## Files Involved

- Test file: `tests/integration/proactive-message-flow.test.js`
- Services: 
  - `backend/services/infrastructure/CORE_SchedulingService.js`
  - `backend/services/infrastructure/CORE_MessageDeliveryService.js`
  - `backend/services/domain/CORE_ProactiveIntelligenceService.js`
- Database: `proactive_engagements`, `users`, `personalities` tables

## Summary

✅ All 5 test scenarios passing
✅ Covers schedule, poll, deliver workflow
✅ Tests online/offline user scenarios
✅ Tests complete end-to-end lifecycle
✅ Proper time-based testing with fake timers
✅ Clean test data management
✅ Integration between multiple services validated
